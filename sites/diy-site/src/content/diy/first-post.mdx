# Welcome to My DIY Section

This is my first DIY post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Design systems and frontend development
- My work at GitHub
- Interface design insights
- Random thoughts and observations

## Getting Started

This DIY section is built with Astro and MDX, which gives me the flexibility to write in Markdown while still being able to include interactive components when needed.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you find something interesting here!
