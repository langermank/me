# Example Case Study

This is the full content of your case study that would appear on its own page when `hasMore` is set to true.

You can use all the power of MDX here:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Code blocks

```javascript
const example = "You can include code examples";
```
